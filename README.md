There were a few things that I wanted to include in my website but coudldn't execute and things that I needed to solve.

These included:

Filter results from lowest to highest price - I really wanted this to work as it was most important to people that I surveyed when looking for accomodation.

A 'back' button on the review booking pop up - I had trouble with the display = 'none' and 'block' for this for some reason. The review booking pop up could change to none but the details pop up wouldn't change to block. Therefore I just made the back button into a cancel button. It would have been nice to have a back button for a better user experience.

Page refreshes - For some reason the website automatically refreshes after a certain amount of time. I have no idea why it does this.

Overflow: scroll - I had some trouble with trying to get the correct background image height size. So i ended up just making the overflow scroll to make it look a little tidier. It doesn't look as nice as I wanted in the mobile view though.
